# Student Dashboard Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Navbar Overlap Issue ✅
- **Problem**: Content was being covered by the fixed navbar
- **Solution**: 
  - Adjusted padding from `pt-20` to `pt-24` in DashboardLayout
  - Reduced dashboard page padding from `pt-20` to `pt-6`
  - Fixed floating tools button position from `top-20` to `top-24`

### 2. Continue Button Functionality ✅
