# Video Player & Dashboard Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Video Time Accuracy Issue ✅
**Problem**: Video player didn't properly sync video duration with actual video metadata
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced metadata loading with multiple event listeners (`loadedmetadata`, `canplay`, `durationchange`)
- Added validation to prevent invalid time values
- Implemented drift detection to catch time inconsistencies
- Added metadata validation flags to ensure accuracy
- Improved real-time sync with actual video duration

**Key Changes**:
- Multiple metadata events for better accuracy
- Enhanced validation with drift detection
- Metadata validation flags
- Reduced update throttle from 1500ms to 1000ms for better real-time accuracy

### 2. Progress Section Improvements ✅
**Problem**: Progress section needed better real-time updates and accuracy
**Solution**:
- Added intelligent caching system with 5-minute cache expiration
- Implemented force refresh functionality
- Enhanced manual refresh with cache clearing
- Added real-time progress data sync
- Improved error handling and user feedback

**Key Changes**:
- Smart caching with timestamp validation
- Force refresh option that clears cache
- Better error handling with user-friendly messages
- Real-time data synchronization

### 3. Notification Section Enhancements ✅
**Problem**: Notifications needed improvements for better user experience
**Solution**:
- Added unread notification counter with visual indicators
- Implemented "Mark All as Read" functionality
- Added refresh button for notifications
- Enhanced visual feedback with animations
- Improved notification interaction with better UX

**Key Changes**:
- Unread counter badge
- Mark all as read functionality
- Refresh notifications button
- Enhanced visual indicators (pulse animations, check marks)
- Better time formatting (relative time display)

### 4. Auto-Reload Replacement ✅
**Problem**: Need to replace auto-refresh with manual refresh buttons
**Solution**:
- Removed automatic refresh intervals
- Added manual refresh button to dashboard header
- Implemented refresh functionality in progress page
- Added loading states and user feedback
- Enhanced caching with manual refresh override

**Key Changes**:
- Manual refresh button in dashboard header
- Refresh button in progress page
- Loading states during refresh
- Cache invalidation on manual refresh
- User feedback with toast notifications
